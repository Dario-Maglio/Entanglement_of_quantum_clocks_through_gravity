-----Entanglement of quantum clocks through gravity by Brukner-----
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The picture of space–time assigns an ideal clock to each world line.
This is an ideal situation because of the mass–energy equivalence which 
implies gravitational interaction between clocks - i.e. quantum mechanical 
superposition of energy eigenstates or metrics.

In this work, we show that quantum mechanical and gravitational properties 
of the clocks put fundamental limits to the joint measurability of time as 
given by clocks along nearby world lines.

Each energy eigenstate of the clock corresponds to a different gravitational 
field. We prove that, as a consequence of this fact, the time dilation of 
clocks evolving along nearby world lines is ill-defined.
The effect leads to entanglement between nearby clocks.

We show how the (classical) general relativistic notion of
time dilation emerges from our model in terms of the average
mass–energy of a gravitating quantum system.

-Clock model
An operational description of the passage of a unit time is given by the 
orthogonalization time. It is also the precision of the clock. The time 
flow in the nearby of the first clock is affected by time dilation and so 
are the real other real clocks. 

There is a trade-off between the accuracy of measuring time at the
location of the clock and the uncertainty of time dilation at nearby points.  

We see from Eq. 5 that the clocks get entangled through
gravitational interaction. The state gets maximally entangled for the 
time tmix. What does it mean???

As we approach tmix, the reduced state of any of the clocks approaches
the maximally mixed state and the clock is no longer able to function as 
a proper clock, because, when we “ask the clock for the time,” 
we get only random answers. How do we ask for time??? What is a max 
mix state??? I think I know the answer.

We build the the reduced state of the zeroth clock and then the reduced 
density matrix. We define the visibility as twice the nondiagonal element 
and we find the decoherence time in first approximation. 

This characterizes the fundamental limit on the time after which
quantum clocks lose their ability to measure time when their
gravitational effects are taken into account.

for a distance
x ≈ 10−13 cm (the order of magnitude of the charge radius of
a proton), an energy gap of ∆E ≈ 10 GeV, which is compara-
ble to, for example, the energy of the nuclear bound state of a
K − particle in 4 He (21), and a macroscopic number of parti-
cles N ≈ 1023 , we find td ≈ 80 s.

It might be possible to perform experiments on analog systems to test 
this effect. Specifically, in PNAS reference 22.

At last, a concept of POVM and Time operator in the classical limit is 
introduced to study the uncertanty relation in the beginning of the article.

Appendix C - QFT approach and Hamiltonian

The article describes a two component scalar field, but the shape of the 
Lagrangian allow an N component description?

How can we obtain C6 from C7 and are csi and eta wave function?
Derivation in PNAS reference 16.

Most interesting papers out of the references, but from Brukner:

In "Castro Ruiz, Brukner  - Quantum clocks in relativity "
we can find a theoretical framework for a timeless approach to QM 
which justifies the definition of a Time operator in the main article 
of our research.

In "Brukner  - Quantum superposition of spacetimes obeys Einstein’s 
Equivalence Principle" we can find a discussion about the concept of 
quantum reference frame and the compatibility with the Equivalence 
principle in GR. According to Penrose point of view!

At last, in "Brukner, Rovelli- Locally mediated entanglement through 
gravity from first principles" I would like to understand how Rovelli 
and Brukner describes retarded entaglement mediation via gravitons 
linearized action. It may be interesting for Nicola.

I have to understand what a POVM is, as in the classical limit for 
the first article. I'm studying QInformation on my own for this 
purpose, but it seems POVM are foundamental independetly of the 
direction of our work.
