Entanglement of quantum clocks through gravity by Brukner

The picture of space–time assigns an ideal clock to each world line.
This is an ideal situation because of the mass–energy equivalence which 
implies gravitational interaction between clocks - i.e. quantum mechanical 
superposition of energy eigenstates or metrics.

In this work, we show that quantum mechanical and gravitational properties 
of the clocks put fundamental limits to the joint measurability of time as 
given by clocks along nearby world lines.

Each energy eigenstate of the clock corresponds to a different gravitational 
field. We prove that, as a consequence of this fact, the time dilation of 
clocks evolving along nearby world lines is ill-defined.
The effect leads to entanglement between nearby clocks.

we show how the (classical) general relativistic notion of
time dilation emerges from our model in terms of the average
mass–energy of a gravitating quantum system.
